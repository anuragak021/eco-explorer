Project Idea: The "Eco-Explorer" App <br> 
The Problem: Urban explorers and tourists often want to find the most scenic or "green" walking route between two points, not just the fastest. <br>
They want a navigation experience that feels fluid and informative, and that works reliably even when their network connection is spotty in dense urban areas or parks.<br>

The Solution: A progressive web app called Eco-Explorer that helps users find and navigate the most pleasant, tree-lined, or park-adjacent walking routes.<br>
The app prioritizes a beautiful, animated, and adaptive user experience.<br>
